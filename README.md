C++ application that determines number of months to repay a car loan.
This C++ console application determines the number of
  months to repay a car loan.  It prompts for and gets from
  the user the car loan amount in the range $1,000-5,000.
  It then prompts for and gets from the user the monthly
  payment in the range $100-500.  It then prompts for and
  gets from the user the annual interest rate in the range
  2-5%.  The application converts the rate to a monthly
  rate.  It then shows the loan being repaid and keeps
  track of the number of months it takes to do so.
